    <h2>Decision Options</h2>
    <p>
      Write every decision option you need to decide for.
      <br />
      If for example, you need to decide which house you want to buy, you may
      write something like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>House in yellowsnow road</li>
      <li>House in seldom seen avenue</li>
      <li>House in pleasant street</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Take some time to think about every other option "out of the box" that may
      also exist.
      <br />
      For example your parent's house, a trailer, a tent. <br />
      <br />
      In case you have a binary decision, you should write two decision options.{" "}
      <br />
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>To divorce</li>
        <li>
          Not to divorce.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      If you need to decide which house to buy, you may write something like
      this:
      <ul>
        <li>Neighborhood</li>
        <li>Size</li>
        <li>Garden</li>
        <li>
          Kitchen

export const WeightCriteriaInfo = (
  <div>
    <h2>Weight Criteria</h2>
    <p>
      Decisions require always trade-0ffs. If not, no decision will be
      necessary.
      <br />
      Under this principle, you should weight your selection criteria.
      <br />
      Which of both criteria are you willing to sacrifice to get the other one?
      <br />
      <br />
      Move the slider to the left or to the right depending on what is more
      important to you.
      <br />
      The distance moved in the slider is proportional to the importance of
      criteria compared to the other.
      <br />
      This as the slider would be a balance between both criteria.
    </p>

export const OptionsRatingInfo = (

    <h2>Rate Options</h2>
    <p>

      <br />
      <br />
      The best option is the one with the highest score on the most important
      criteria for you.
      <br />
      It's also the one in which you are facing the minimum amount of
      trade-offs.
